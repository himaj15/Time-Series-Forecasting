# Time-Series-Forecasting

Built a model to Forecast monthly sales of Wine for certain Wine Estate for the next 12 months

Analyzed historical monthly sales data of a company. Created multiple forecast models for two different products of a particular Wine Estate and recommended the optimum forecasting model to predict monthly sales for the next 12 months along with appropriate lower and upper confidence limits.

Forecasting Models used-

- Linear Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Simple Average
- 2-pt Moving Average
- 4-pt Moving Average
- 6-pt Moving Average
- 9-pt Moving Average
- Single Exponential Smoothing
- Double Exponential Smoothing (Holtâ€™s Model)
- Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winter Model)
- ARIMA / SARIMA (Auto fitted)
- ARIMA / SARIMA (Manually fitted)

Metric used for Comparision on models is --> RMSE on Test data
